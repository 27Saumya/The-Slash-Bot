## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Java LTS 11+
Check out. the `requirements.txt` and install all the pakages. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Make sure you have the [Lavalink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases) file and the [application.yml](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example) file too

## Installing

You can either fork this repo or just download the zip
You will need Python 3.

## Getting Started!

Change the following:
`guild_ids`: I have added ... instead of the `guild_ids`. Why guild_ids and not global? Many people might have raised this question. Slash Commands may take an hour to register whereas adding selected guilds, it registers in an instantâš¡.

Make sure you have the `main.db` file in the `utils/databases` directory and a `config.py` in the main directory with your [TENOR](https://tenor.com/developer/keyregistration) api key

> 

First use `java -jar Lavalink.jar` to run the Lavalink Node!
Then use `python bot.py`
and you are good to go!
