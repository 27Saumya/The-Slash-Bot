## Prerequisites

Python 3+
Check out. the `requirements.txt` and install all the pakages.

## Installing

You can either fork this repo or just download the zip
You will need Python 3.

## Getting Started!

Change the following:
`guild_ids`: I have added ... instead of the `guild_ids`. Why guild_ids and not global? Many people might have raised this question. Slash Commands may take an hour to register whereas adding selected guilds, it registers in an instantâš¡.

```python
guild_ids=[824969244860088332, 847740349853073418, 865962392093851658, 896457384552202312, 918802666790993951]
```
